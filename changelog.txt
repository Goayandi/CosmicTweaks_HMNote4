<*>New - Aroma Installer</*>
    - Made lots of existing features optional
    - Add Insecure ADB On Boot option
    - Probably more awesome stuff that I can't remember because I kind of dropped off the face of the planet for too long and didn't take complete notes
<*>New - QuickSearchBox translation/globalize overlay</*>
<*>New - Init.d script - Clear icon cache every boot (useful for Unicon users... Unicon still only works sometimes sadly)</*>
<*>Remove - MiRemote APK replacement (not very interesting, just keep the original firmware one)</*>
<*>Remove - WallpaperCarousel APK replacement (as above)</*>
<*>Remove - /cust wipe feature (no longer useful)</*>
<*>Fix - Init.d scripts shouldn't block flow control</*>
